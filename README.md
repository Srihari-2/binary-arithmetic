Simple Arithmetic Operations in C

This C program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two integers entered by the user.

Features
Arithmetic Operations:
Addition: Adds two integers.
Subtraction: Subtracts the second integer from the first.
Multiplication: Multiplies two integers.
Division: Divides the first integer by the second.
Usage
Compile the Program:

bash
Copy code
gcc arithmetic.c -o arithmetic
Run the Program:

bash
Copy code
./arithmetic
Follow On-Screen Instructions:

Enter two integers when prompted.
The program will display the result of each arithmetic operation.
Input Validation
The program assumes valid input (two integers) from the user. It does not perform input validation or handle invalid input scenarios.
Limitations
Division by Zero: The program does not check for division by zero. If the second integer entered by the user is zero, the program will result in undefined behavior or a runtime error.
Contributions
Contributions to enhance the functionality, error handling, and usability of this program are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
